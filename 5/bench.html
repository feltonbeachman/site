    <h1>Bench Press Guide</h1>

    <p>I love bench press. It’s so fun. Here’s how I bench:</p>

    <p>1. Pad must be sticky, with give.<br>
    1.1 Two points of contact: traps and feet.<br>
    1.2 A sticky pad with give secures the traps and enables backward slide (see 11).</p>

    <p>2. Hips higher than knees to maximize force transfer off the floor.</p>

    <p>3. Hold bar with minimal grip to enable effective use of upper back musculature.<br>
    3.1 Chalk up hands and use bar with aggressive knurling.<br>
    3.2 I like bar at meaty base of palms, with wrists cocked back.<br>
    3.3 Hands get diagonal and turn towards each other on their own with bar at base of palms.<br>
    3.4 Bar will remain in place no matter what, even if you release fingers.<br>
    3.5 With minimal grip, let your back work on eccentric as opposed to arms.<br>
    3.6 Back is better suited to handling bar than arms.<br>
    3.7 Bar becomes an extension of the body.</p>

    <p>4. Unrack with maximum leg drive and shoulder retraction and depression.<br>
    4.1 Leg drive creates back position that enables effective use of upper back musculature.<br>
    4.2 Shoulder retraction and depression enable effective use of upper back musculature.<br>
    4.3 Stack arms vertically under bar, meaning wrists and elbows along same vertical plane.<br>
    4.4 To stack arms under racked bar, you must flare the elbows.</p>

    <p>5. Butt is high up from maximum leg drive. Extend the triceps to unrack.<br>
    5.1 Guide the bar forward by changing elbow angle, bringing elbows closer to chest.<br>
    5.2 Again, don't grip the shit out of the bar. Let your upper back work.<br>
    5.3 Move forward with locked arms until upper back feels secure.</p>

    <p>6. Set your butt down.<br>
    6.1 Don't bear weight with your butt.<br>
    6.2 Bearing weight with butt kills force transfer off the floor.<br>
    6.3 Set butt down to where you're barely touching the pad. Let's call it "hover butt."<br>
    6.4 "Hover butt" is another way of describing persistent leg drive.<br>
    6.5 "Hover butt" ensures maximum force transfer off the floor and to the bar.<br>
    6.6 "Hover butt" maintains upper back position to enable effective use of upper back musculature.</p>

    <p>7. Move the bar down.<br>
    7.1 Maintain the loosest possible grip.<br>
    7.2 Load your upper back on the eccentric. Use your upper back to move the bar.<br>
    7.3 The back position you developed in previous steps makes it easy to recruit upper back musculature.<br>
    7.4 Move bar down with intent, deliberately going as fast as possible.<br>
    7.5 This impacts the nervous system, improving its ability to recruit muscle fibers.<br>
    7.6 Fast eccentric also loads the stretch reflex, making the press easier.<br>
    7.7 Fast eccentric is a product of good positioning and effective use of upper back musculature.<br>
    7.8 Fast eccentric improves bar control given effects on nervous system that enhance muscle fiber recruitment.</p>

    <p>8. Use a bar path that takes full advantage of leg drive and maximizes force transfer off the floor.<br>
    8.1 Leg drive is a horizontal force.<br>
    8.2 Create an efficient bar path by setting up the conditions for a backward press, not an upward press, which resists the horizontal force.<br>
    8.3 To do this, touch lower by bringing elbows closer to chest.<br>
    8.4 Maintain stacked arms under bar. Don't tuck elbows to where they're closer to chest than your wrists.<br>
    8.5 Distance between elbow and chest and wrist and chest must be the same.</p>

    <p>9. Touch low, so long as you angle forearms backwards.<br>
    9.1 I touch as low as possible with backwards forearms.<br>
    9.2 Backwards forearms means elbows slightly in front of wrists, which are closer to rack than elbows.<br>
    9.3 This creates a pressing position in sync with leg drive, ready to launch back towards rack.<br>
    9.4 You don't want elbows behind wrists, to where elbows are closer to rack than wrists.</p>

    <p>10. Press towards the rack to take full advantage of leg drive.<br>
    10.1 To move bar towards rack and in line with leg drive, which is a horizontal force, you must change elbow angle.<br>
    10.2 Go from elbows closer to chest at bottom, to flared elbows farther from chest at lockout.<br>
    10.3 Flaring elbows enables horizontal movement of bar, meaning backwards towards rack.<br>
    10.4 Not flaring elbows results in moving bar upwards and not backwards.<br>
    10.5 Moving upwards resists leg drive, sapping your power.</p>

    <p>11. Don't dig in with the traps.<br>
    11.1 When pressing, you want to almost try to slide traps back, so to speak, as if you're trying to get your head to fall off the edge.<br>
    11.2 So it's as if you're trying to move the body back, and not down into the pad.<br>
    11.3 Digging into the pad saps your power.<br>
    11.4 By trying to move back, you're maximizing the force transfer off the floor and into the bar.<br>
    11.5 By working with a sticky pad with give, you can try to slide off as much as possible, and your traps will remain in place.</p>
