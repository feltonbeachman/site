    <h1>Bench Press Love</h1>

    <p>I love to bench press. It’s a lot of fun. Here’s how I bench:</p>

    <p>1- The pad must be sticky and have a lot of give. Stickiness ensures the traps stay in one place, and the cushiony pad helps secure the upper body point of contact as you slide back on the press portion (see number 10). There are two points of contact in bench: the traps and the feet. With the lower body, make sure that in your final position, the hips are higher than the knees. This helps get the best possible force transfer off the floor.</p>

    <p>2- When you hold the bar, hold it with minimal grip. This enables effective use of upper back musculature. To accommodate this, use a bar with aggressive knurling and use plenty of chalk. The bar will be at the meaty base of the palms, with the wrists cocked back. You’ll find your hands turning towards each other on their own as you line up the bar with the base of your hands. Don’t force the hands-turning-towards-each-other thing. That’s something that happens on its own when the bar gets comfy at the base of the hands, which are gonna get oriented in a diagonal way on their own. With this, no matter how heavy the weight, you can release your fingers and the bar will remain in place. With a less grippy grip, you’re letting your back do the work on the eccentric as opposed to the arms. The back is better suited to the task than your arms. The bar becomes an extension of your body. It’s part of you. You can do anything with it.</p>

    <p>3- When unracking, leg drive should be at a maximum. Leg drive creates the back position that enables effective use of upper back musculature. When unracking, shoulders must be maximally retracted and depressed. Shoulders will be maximally retracted and depressed the entire time. This enables the back position we want. The arms must be stacked vertically under the bar, meaning wrists and elbows along the same vertical plane. In order to have those stacked arms with the bar racked, you must flare the elbows.</p>

    <p>4- While maintaining full leg drive, unrack the bar by extending the triceps. Guide the bar forward by bringing the elbows closer to the chest, so you’re going from a flared elbow angle to something closer. Again, don’t grip the shit out of the bar. You’re letting your upper back do the work. Once you’ve moved forward enough with those locked arms and reached a perfectly balanced, comfy position, it’s time to set the butt down.</p>

    <p>5- Do not bear weight on your butt. Don’t you ever do it. When you’re trying to bench as heavy as possible, you want to maximize the force transfer off the floor. Bearing weight with your butt saps your power. Bring your butt down to where you’re barely even touching the pad. We’ll call this “hover butt.” It’s another way of describing persistent leg drive. “Hover butt” will ensure maximum force transfer off the floor and to the bar. The other great thing about persistent leg drive is that it maintains your upper back position the entire time. Leg drive creates and reinforces that upper back position that enables effective use of upper back musculature.</p>

    <p>6- It’s time to move the bar down. We’re not gripping the shit out of the bar, and we’re gonna let our upper back do the work. Load your upper back on the eccentric. The back position you’ve created with your positioning will make it easy to recruit the upper back musculature. You want to move the bar down with intent, meaning deliberately moving as fast as possible. This will impact your nervous system, improving its ability to recruit muscle fibers. The fast eccentric will also load the stretch reflex, helping you come off the bottom position. A fast eccentric is enabled by good positioning and muscle engagement. If your positioning is sound and you know to load your upper back on the eccentric, the fast eccentric will be easy to execute, and in fact will allow you to recruit more muscle fibers and be in even more control of the bar.</p>

    <p>7- Now, in order to take advantage of your leg drive and maximize the force transfer, you must use an efficient bar path. Leg drive is a horizontal force. We want to set up the conditions for a backwards press, not an upward press, which resists the horizontal force. You want to touch lower on your chest by bringing the elbows closer (closing the elbow angle). Of course, the arms must be stacked under the bar at all times, so never tuck the elbows such that the elbows are closer to the chest than the wrists. The distance between elbow and chest and wrist and chest should be the same.</p>

    <p>8- You can touch down as low as you want, so long as you maintain a backwards forearm angle, which means that the elbows will be slightly in front of the wrists, which are pointing towards the rack. This creates a pressing position in sync with leg drive, ready to launch the bar back to the rack. You don’t want the elbows to be behind the wrists, to where the elbows are closer to the rack than the wrists. You want the wrists closer to the rack than the elbows.</p>

    <p>9- After touching down with backwards forearms, press towards the rack to take full advantage of leg drive. In order to get the bar to move back towards the rack and in line with leg drive, which is a horizontal force, you must change the elbow angle. We’re gonna go from that elbow angle that’s closer to the chest at the bottom position to one where the elbows are flared. Flaring the elbows enables the bar to move horizontally. If you don’t flare the elbows, you’re gonna be moving the bar upwards and you’ll be resisting leg drive, sapping all your power.</p>

    <p>10- And remember what I said about bearing weight with the butt sapping your power? Something similar goes for your traps, too. When pressing, you want to almost slide the traps back, so to speak, as if you’re trying to slide your entire body off the pad, trying to get your head to fall off the edge. So move the body back, and not down into the pad. You don’t wanna dig into the pad. This is why making a sticky pad and working with a pad that has give are important.</p>
